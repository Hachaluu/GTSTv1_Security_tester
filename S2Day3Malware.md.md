Malware Threats
# What is Malware
- A malware is a set of program that run on your pc and make you system to be slave of the attacker.
- The name came from: 
	- Malicious
	- Software
## What can Malware do
- Remove data
- Encrypt data
- Corrupting data
- Spying on the user
- Stealing data
## Kinds of Malwares
1. Trojan
2. Worm
3. Virus
4. Ransomware
5. Rootkit
6. Adware

## TROJAN
- Is a type of malware it looks like legitimate but can control a computer
- Don't replicate
### Common types of Trojan
1. Backdoor Trojan
	- It can create a backdoor on the computer.
2. Mail finder Trojan
	- It stole an email address on your device.
3. Remote Access Trojan 
	- Can give a full control of your pc to the attacker via a remote network connection.  It include spying on you and stealing your file
4. Trojan Banker
	- It's aim is on your financial account. It will steal all your account information for all the online things you do.

## Worm
- It can replicate from one computer to another 
- It will spread across the internet.
- It will damage the files on the system
## Virus
- They are older malwares.
- They can replicate them self, they might corrupt or delete data on your computer.
### Common sign of virus infection
- Speed of System
-  Pop-up windows
-  Self-executing
-  Account being log out
-  Crashing of device
-  Mass emails being sent from you
-  Files and system settings are altered.
## Ransomware
- It encrypt the victim's information, So that the user cannot get access to the file when they want to get access to their file they have to pay and the ransom will let them access.
## Rootkit
- It is a malicious software bundle designed to give unauthorized access to a computer or other software.
- They are hard to detect, hackers use them to get remote access to computers.
## Adware
- A software that displays unwanted advertisements on a computer.
- They can change your browser's homepage, add spyware ......
## How do malwares infect
- USB drop attack
- Spam emails
- Malicious office macros
- Software/apps from unsafe websites
	- Torrent sites
- Using Cracked Soft wares
- Malicious Browser extension
## How they are hidden/ undetected
1. Packers
	- Is a program that compress an executable to make it smaller. Then they will add to the code .
	- Packing changes the binary pattern to avoid detaction. 
2. Crypters/encoders
	- Same to package but it add additional obfuscation or encryption to the mix , it goal is to avoid detection.
3. Polymorphic Malware
	- It is malware that uses packing repeatedly to change how it looks.
4. Downloaders, Droppers, and Staged Loading

 # [[Malware Prevention]]
 1. Use antivirus and anti-spyware software 
	- ex: Kaspersky , avg, smadav
 2. Use secure authentication 
	 - 2-factor authentication 
	 - Implement email security and spam protection 
3. Keep the software updated
4. Use the least-privilege model
5. Monitor for suspicious activity
6. Educate your user
# Some malware happened in history
1. Morris Worm
2. ILOVEYOU
3. Stuxnet
4. WannaCry
# Python for Malware development
- There are so many kinds of malware purpose
	- Delete files
	- Encrypt file
	- Corrupt file
## Malware #1 - file deleting malware
- When it load it will delete files
- TO do these:
![[Pasted image 20230820141539.png]]
- You have to run them in the right folder, and go to that folder on your terminal/ Powershell .
# File Handling in python
- Files are names locations on disk to store related info.
- Files used to store a data in storage devices
- In python file operation takes place by:
	- Opening a file
	- Reading and Writing 
	- Closing the file
- It has a function called open().
- Modes:
	- write ----------w (this will overwrite )
	- read -----------r
	- append--------a
	- create ---------x
	- text mode -----t
	- binary mode --b
```python
# To write
with open ("fileName",'w') as var:
	var.write("some thing")

```
###  Reading files
read() :> this will read file up to the inputed size number
readline()  :> to read only line line
readlines()  :> to read all file in 1 line
```python
# To read
with open ("file name", 'r') as var:
	a = var.read()
	print(a)
```
### Creating file
- We need to add x mode to the type.
- But if the file exists it will be a file exist error
	- To pass this:
		 ```python
		 import os
		 if os.path.exists("filename"):
			 print("the file exists")
		else:
			print("no file")
		```

## Malware #2 - File ransomware
- It's algorithm is:
	- they scan the system files
	- they will encrypt them with some key
	- done
- We can doo the decrypter to 
	- It accepts the key
	- Decrypt the system files
- To do this we can use the Fernet module from cryptography:
ransomware code

# Malware Analysis
- It is a process of analyzing malware.
- There are two type of analysis:
	- Static Analysis:  Analyzing the virus by just seeing the byte code and the meta data.
	- Dynamic Analysis: Analyzing the virus by running the malware in sandbox/virtual machine. Then understanding the malware behavior.
