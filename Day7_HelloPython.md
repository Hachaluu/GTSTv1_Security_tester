# What is programming language
- It is a language that helps to communicate with computers.
- Prog lang. helps to write program using this language 
## What is programming
- It is an algorithm expressed in a programming language.
### Evolution of 1/0 {input/Output}
Early in the history of computing, programs were on [punch card with all the data]
#### Generation of Computers
1. First Generation  = Vacuum Tubes => punch cards
2. Second Generation = Transistors => Programming started here with Assembly
3. Third Generation  = Integrated Circuits => BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, Fortran, C, C++, Perl and Ada
4. Fourth Generation  = Microprocessors => Python, SQL, Matlab
5. Fifth Generation  =  Artificial Intelligence

# Types of Programming Languages
1. Low level programming language
This language are more like Machines but peoples can barely understand them.
Ex.  Assembly
2. High level Programming Languages
They are more close to human language.
Ex. Python, C++, Java, JS..........
3. Medium Level
They are between Low level and High level
Ex. C-lang
# How do high level languages work
It uses :
	1. Compilers: are tools to convert the whole code to bytecode.   For example : C++, Java
	2. Interpreter: it directly execute the code by reading the source code.  For example: Python
## Uses of Programming language
● Android Application Development
● Website Development
● Machine learning
● Artificial Intelligence
● Game Development
● Big data Technology
● Desktop software development
● Hacking tool development

# What is python programming 
- It is a High level and interpreted language
## Uses of Python
● Data visualization
● Data analysis
● Machine learning
● Artificial intelligence
● Back-end web development (with frameworks like Django and Flask)
● Game development
● Hacking Script writing

### IDE and CODE EDITORS
1. [IDE ( Integrated Development Enviroment ): Is a 
Software that helps to write & run a Specific Programming 
language.] Example: Python IDE
2. [Code Editors: are soft wares those can help to write any 
kind of programming languages. And also by adding some 
compiling/ interpreting feature they can run 
programs/scripts Example: Sublime, Vs code]

#### Outputs and Comments
- On python To display output we use keyword 'Print'
```python
print("you are powerful","Who are you",sep=', ', end='!')
\n - new line
\t - tab space
#- single line comment 

```
# Variables
- They are value holders. They store data
- The process of giving a variable a value is called "Declaration"
- The word that holds the data is called "Identifier"
```python
num=10
print("the number that the variable is storing is: ", num)
print(f"the number that the variable is storing is: {num}")
```
# Data types
1. Numeric data type
- int
- float
- complex
2. String data type 
- It is a sequence of characters represented by either double quote or single quote.
3. Sequence Data
- list  => it is an ordered collection of items
```python
name=['hachalu','jaha', 'mojo','yofa']
print(name)

print(name[0])

name.append("Braj")

print(name)
```
- Tuple  => it is same as list but in this case we can't modify the values, and also we use () to store the items .
```python
students=('jhon', 'abeni', 'abel', 'elsa')
print(students)
print(students[2])

```
4. Dictionary data type
- In python it is an unordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs
- We use key to get the value of the key.
- We use {} to store the values.
```python 
computer_brand={'dell': 'windows 10', 'toshiba': 'windows 7', 'alienware': 'windows 12'}
print(computer_brand['alienware'])  #This will print 'windows 12'
```
