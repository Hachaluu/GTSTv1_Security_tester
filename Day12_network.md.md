Networking for hackers
# Introduction to Networking
- A network consists of two or more objects sharing info.
- A computer network consists of two or more computing devices connected two each other to share resource and information .
- Network is more power full when the sharing is in the same network.
- Computer on a network can act as:
	- Client
	- Server
1. Client : >  is a computer that request for resources.
2. Server : > is a computer that answer for the request that came from the client.
	- It have a higher RAM, CPU, STORAGE
## What are the need for networks
- Enhance communications
- Share resources
- Internet
### Classification of Networks
1. By network Geography
2. By component roles
# Classification by Network Geography
1. [LAN (Local Area Network)]
It covers relatively small area like class room, single building........
They are expensive to install but very fast.
2. [MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)]
It covers an area like city....
The cost is very high.
It uses high speed connections like fiber optics
3. [WAN (Wide Area Network)]
It covers larger area than a city.
The example of this kind of network is INTERNET
It uses telecommunication network
# Classification by Component Role
1. Peer-to-Peer
- All computers are considered as equal.
- Not expensive, also they are very easy to install.
- Each computer can act as a [client] or a [server]
- It is popular as home network , it's maximum number is 10
2. Server Based
- It offers centralized control and is designed for secure operations.
- A dedicated server controls the network.
3. Client Based
- It process request from clients and return just the result.
- This network take advantage of the powerful processing capability of the client and he server.
Example:
	- Application server and Communication Server
# IP (Internet Protocol)  address
- It is a network layout protocol.
- It is unique for each computers.
## Usage of IP
- To connect to another computer or nertwork.
- Allows transfer of files and email
- Identify a device
## Type of IP address
- Based on the IP versions:
	- IPv4
	- IPv6
# IPv4 (Internet protocol version 4)
- It is 32-bit
- Doted decimal format - is the way of writing IP address as four decimal numbers separated by periods(.).
- IP can be generated by DHCP or Manually
## IP Structure
It consists of four sections, each section is 8 bits long, and also it can range from 0 - 255
- 192.168.1.1  is called GATEWAY ADDRESS
- Every IP has two parts 
	- Network:  to identify the network
	- Host:  to identify the user ![[Pasted image 20230819101717.png]]
## Private and Public IP addresses
Any IP have 2 different IP's
	- Public IP:
		It is an IP that is given to the host on the WAN .
	- Private IP:
		It is an IP that is given to the host on the LAN.
## Class of IP address
CLASS A:  Governments
CLASS B:  Medium Companies 
CLASS C:  Small Companies
CLASS D:  Multi Casting (streaming)
CLASS E:   Future Use (IETF research)
### CLASS A
- Have 24-bits for HOSTS
![[Pasted image 20230819102424.png]]
### CLASS B
- Have 16-bits for HOSTS
![[Pasted image 20230819102514.png]]
### CLASS C
- Have 8-bits for HOSTS
![[Pasted image 20230819102557.png]]
- It is used on our home, school and office network
- The device on the same network have the same starting IP number but the last 8-bit is the one that will be changed.
## Reserved IP Address 
- Some host addresses are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices on a network.
- Address that begin with 127 are reserved for loopback and internal testing.
- IP that has 0 in all host bit positions is reserved for the network address.
- IP that has 1 or 255 in all host bit positions is reserved for the broadcast address.
- Example of reserved IP addresses are :
	- 0.0.0.0 
	- 127.0.0.0 
	- 128.0.0.0
	- 191.255.0.0
	- 192.0.0.0
	- 223.255.255.0
# IPv5 (Internet Protocol version 6)
- It is 128-bit alphanumeric long value that identifies an endpoint devices in IPv6 network.
- Format of an IPv6 address:
	- FE80:CD00:0000:0CDE:1257:0000:211E:729C
		- ALPHANumeric
		- Separated by colon(:)
		- IP generated automatically

To know your IP address:
- on windows: 
```cmd
ipconfig
```
- on linux:
```shell
ifconfig
```
_________
# MAC (Media Access Control) Address
- It is given by the Manufacturer of that [network adapter ] .
- [Network Adapter ]: is a hardware device that helps us to have connection(our wifi adapter)
- It is alphanumeric with 2 parts :
	- Organizational Unique Id
	- Network Interference Control (NIC)

[MAC ]: 
	- Flat name space of 48 bits
		- Typically written in six octets in hex
	Organizationally unique identifier 
		- Assigned by IEEE Registration Authority 
		- Determines the first 24 bits of the address
		- 00-15-C5-- corresponds to "Dell Inc"
	Remainder of the MAC address
		- Allocate by the manufacturer 
# OSI (Open System Interconnection) Reference Model
- OSI Reference Model - internationally standardized network architecture 
- Specified in ISO 7498 
- Is an idea to show how network works.
- [+] Layers 1-4 relate to 
communications 
technology.
- [+] Layers 5-7 relate to user applications.

## Layer 7: Application Layer 
- Is level where apps access network services
- The data is DATA.
- Protocols: HTTP, FTP, SMTP
## Layer 6: Presentation Layer 
- Representation of transmitted data
- Provide service for secure efficient data transmission
	- data encryption   and  data compression
- Your data is DATA
- Protocols: SSL
## Layer 5: Session Layer
- Allows two app in different computer to establish, use, and end a session.
- Establish dialog control.
- Your data is DATA
- Protocols: RPC, NETBIOS
## Layer 4: Transport Layer 
- Manages transmission packets
- Handles error recognitions and recovery.
- Your data is SEGMENT
- Protocols: TCO, UDP
## Layer 3: Network Layer
- Manages addressing of data within the IP range 
- Your data is PACKETS.
- Protocols: ICMP, ARP, NAT, IP
## Layer 2: Data Link Layer 
- Provides reliable transmission of Frames.
- Your data is DATA
- Protocols: PPP, NDP, CDP
## Layer 1: Physical layer 
- Transmits bits from one computer to another one.
- Tells how cables are attached to the network adapter and what transmission technique is used to send data over the cable.
# TCP and UDP
## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
- Is reliable 
- Connection Oriented protocol
	- It creates a connection between the receiver and sender.
- Used on email, chat, simple browsing
## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
- Is connection less 
- faster, less reliable 
- like streaming, gaming.
### TCP /IP MODEL
It is like OSI model but new and most used model at this time.
It have 5 layers.
# Firewall
- Is a network security device that monitors incoming and outgoing network and decide to block or not.
# Networking Tools
- Switches/Hub and Routers
- Repeater: helps to boost the speed of the internet in long route
- Bridge
-
